# 🌾 AgriConnect — Smart Agriculture Marketplace

AgriConnect is a full-stack agriculture marketplace that connects **Farmers** directly with **Buyers**, eliminating middlemen. It combines e-commerce functionality with agriculture-focused tools like crop recommendations, weather insights, and government scheme information — all in one role-based platform.

---

## 📌 Overview

- **Farmers** can list products/agri-inputs, track orders, view analytics, get crop recommendations, and access weather & government schemes.
- **Buyers** can browse products, manage cart/wishlist, apply coupons, place orders, and make secure payments.
- **Admins/SuperAdmins** manage users, products, orders, coupons, and view platform-wide analytics.

This spins up MySQL, Redis, backend (port `8080`), and frontend (port `8081`) together.

### Run Manually

**Backend**
```bash
cd AgriConnect
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd agriconnect-frontend/agriconnect-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
Configure a `.env` file with your database credentials, JWT secret, and API keys for Razorpay, PhonePe, Cloudinary, and Weather API before running.
